# üö® Transaction Recovery Guide: USDT Deducted But No Eggs Received

## Problem Description

Some users are experiencing an issue where:
- ‚úÖ USDT is successfully deducted from their wallet  
- ‚ùå Eggs are NOT credited to their website account
- üíî Users lose money without receiving the purchased eggs

## Root Cause

This happens when users send USDT transactions to the blockchain, but the backend API call fails due to:
- Network connectivity issues
- Server downtime or high load
- Browser refresh during the transaction process
- API timeouts or errors

## ‚úÖ Solution: Atomic Transaction System

We've implemented a robust atomic transaction system that:

1. **Creates pending transaction records** before processing
2. **Automatically retries failed transactions** every 30 seconds
3. **Prevents duplicate processing** of the same transaction
4. **Provides multiple recovery options** for affected users

## üîß Recovery Options

### Option 1: Automatic Recovery (Recommended)
**The system will automatically process your transaction within 2-5 seconds**

- Immediate processing with 3 fast-track attempts (1s, 2s delays)
- High-priority immediate queue processing
- Background jobs run every 3 seconds
- Failed transactions are retried up to 5 times
- Most users will see their eggs appear automatically within seconds

### Option 2: Manual Recovery via API
Use the recovery endpoint to manually process your transaction:

```bash
POST /nige-nest/escrow/recover-transaction
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN

{
  "transactionHash": "0x1234...",
  "chain": "bsc",  // or "solana"
  "numEggs": 10
}
```

### Option 3: Check Transaction Status
Check if your transaction is being processed:

```bash
POST /nige-nest/escrow/check-transaction-status
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN

{
  "transactionHash": "0x1234..."
}
```

### Option 4: Recovery Script (For Developers)
Add your transaction details to the recovery script:

```bash
# Edit src/scripts/recover-pending-transactions.ts
# Add your transaction to the RECOVERY_REQUESTS array
# Run: bun run src/scripts/recover-pending-transactions.ts
```

## üìã What You Need for Recovery

To recover your transaction, you'll need:

1. **Transaction Hash** - The blockchain transaction ID (starts with 0x for BSC)
2. **Chain** - Either "bsc" or "solana"  
3. **Number of Eggs** - How many eggs you tried to purchase
4. **Account ID** - Your user account ID (from JWT token)

## üîç How to Find Your Transaction Hash

### For BSC (Binance Smart Chain):
1. Go to [BscScan.com](https://bscscan.com)
2. Search for your wallet address
3. Find the USDT transfer to `0xA761A68499753C68747398EB2B91eF308970c3e4`
4. Copy the transaction hash

### For Solana:
1. Go to [Solscan.io](https://solscan.io)
2. Search for your wallet address
3. Find the USDT transfer transaction
4. Copy the transaction signature

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention: New Atomic Flow

**For future purchases, the new atomic system prevents this issue:**

1. **Prepare Transaction** - Creates pending record first
2. **Send Blockchain Transaction** - USDT transfer happens
3. **Automatic Processing** - Background jobs ensure completion
4. **Guaranteed Delivery** - Eggs are credited or transaction is retried

## üìä Transaction Status Meanings

| Status | Description | Action Needed |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `pending` | Waiting to be processed | Wait 1-2 minutes |
| `processing` | Currently being verified | Wait for completion |
| `completed` | Successfully processed | Eggs should be in account |
| `failed` | Failed but will retry | Wait for automatic retry |

## üöÄ API Endpoints Reference

### User Endpoints:
- `POST /nige-nest/escrow/buy-eggs` - New atomic purchase flow
- `POST /nige-nest/escrow/recover-transaction` - Manual recovery
- `POST /nige-nest/escrow/check-transaction-status` - Check status
- `GET /nige-nest/escrow/pending-transactions` - List your pending transactions

### Admin Endpoints:
- `POST /nige-nest/escrow/trigger-background-processing` - Manual trigger (dev only)

## üîß Technical Details

### Multi-Layer Processing System:
- **Fast-Track Processing**: 3 immediate attempts with 1s, 2s delays
- **Immediate Queue**: High-priority queue with exponential backoff
- **Background Jobs**: Every 3 seconds for any remaining transactions
- **Retry Limit**: 5 attempts per transaction
- **Retry Delay**: 10 seconds between failed attempts (much faster)
- **Verification**: On-chain transaction verification before processing

### Security Features:
- Duplicate transaction prevention
- On-chain verification required
- User authentication required
- Wallet connection validation

## üí° Tips for Users

1. **Don't panic** - Your USDT is not lost, the system will recover it
2. **Wait 5-10 seconds** before trying manual recovery (much faster now!)
3. **Don't retry the purchase** - This creates duplicate transactions
4. **Check your pending transactions** using the API endpoint
5. **Contact support** if issues persist after 30 seconds

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Transaction already exists"**
- ‚úÖ Your transaction was already processed
- Check your egg balance

**"Transaction verification failed"**
- ‚ùå Transaction might not be confirmed on blockchain yet
- Wait 2-3 minutes and try again

**"Wallet connection required"**
- üîó Connect your wallet before attempting recovery
- Ensure Twitter + Wallet authentication is complete

**"User not found"**
- üë§ Make sure you're logged in with the correct Twitter account

## üìû Support

If you're still experiencing issues after trying the recovery options:

1. **Gather Information:**
   - Transaction hash
   - Expected number of eggs
   - Time of transaction
   - Wallet address used

2. **Contact Support:**
   - Include all the information above
   - Reference this guide
   - Mention "USDT deduction without eggs"

## üîÑ System Monitoring

The development team monitors:
- Pending transaction queue size
- Failed transaction rates  
- Background job performance
- Recovery success rates

This ensures the atomic transaction system works reliably for all users.

**Remember**: The new atomic transaction system prevents this issue from happening in the future. Existing affected transactions will be automatically recovered by the background processing system.
